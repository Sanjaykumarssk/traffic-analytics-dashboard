# Real-Time Traffic Congestion Analysis Dashboard

A full-stack web application for analyzing traffic routes using real-time data, cost-based optimization, and machine learning–based congestion prediction.

---

## Overview

This project analyzes traffic routes between two locations and identifies the optimal route based on travel time, congestion, distance, and computed cost.  
It integrates real-time traffic data, backend analysis, and interactive map-based visualization.

## Key Features

- Real-time traffic and routing using TomTom API  
- Multiple route comparison with detailed metrics  
- Deterministic cost calculation based on time, delay, and distance  
- Machine learning–based congestion prediction (Random Forest)  
- Interactive map visualization using Leaflet  
- SQLite database for storing analysis results  
- Optional Power BI streaming integration
